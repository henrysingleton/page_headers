# Custom Page Headers Symphony Extension

- Version: 1.2.1
- Author: Henry Singleton
- Build Date: 29 10 2014
- Requirements: Symphony 2.2.x - Symphony 2.5.x

## Overview

This Symphony CMS extension allows you to define headers by page output. This lets you build headers using data from datasources or other page information. Anything that's accessible from a standard page really!

Great for generating redirect urls for 301/302 redirects if you need information from existing Symphony entries, or want to store redirect stats via an event etc.

## Installation

1. Upload the 'page_headers' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Page Headers" extension, choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

## Usage

- Create a new page, and give it a page type of 'headers'.
- Make the page output plain text that you want for your headers. If you also want to output actual page content in the message body, simply separate your headers by a blank newline (as per the HTTP spec for separating message headers/body).

## Notes

If HTML/XML is detected at the start of the page output, the extension will not do anything, even if the 'headers' page type is set.

## Example

Create a new page, give it a page type of 'headers' and save the following as the page template content:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

	<xsl:output method="xml"
		omit-xml-declaration="yes"
		encoding="UTF-8"
		indent="yes" />

	<xsl:template match="/">
		HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
		Location: http://www.google.com/
	</xsl:template>

	</xsl:stylesheet>

Here is an exmpale of custom 404 page, implemented in a different way. Note that you'll need to ensure there are two empty lines
between your headers and any page content you want to output (as per the HTTP spec).

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

	<xsl:output method="xml"
		omit-xml-declaration="yes"
		encoding="UTF-8"
		indent="yes" />

	<xsl:template match="/">
		<xsl:text>HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found

	</xsl:text>

		<h1>Page not found</h1>

		<p>Try our homepage</p>

	</xsl:template>

	</xsl:stylesheet>
